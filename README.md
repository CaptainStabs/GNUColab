# **GNU Colab**

*In here we set an environment in which you can persistently run desktop programs.*

This notebook lets you **run desktop programs on colab machines** drawn on your local terminal through VNC.

To be more precise, this notebook sets up a *regular* remote personal computer, with users and configurations preserved even when the machine turns off.

Actually, the machine is capable of editing itself so you can even use this to let colab machine not dying of idling.

At this moment, the notebook is pre-configured to run either **MATE** or **XFCE**.
